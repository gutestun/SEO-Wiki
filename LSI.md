# LSI

## Definition
**Latent Semantic Indexing** – An outdated way of determining meaning and importance of keywords being sold by quacks and snake oil salesmen. Not useful in your job as an SEO.

>There's no such thing as LSI keywords -- anyone who's telling you otherwise is mistaken, sorry.

Better to look at [[NLP|Natural Language Processing (NLP)]] and co-occurence.
