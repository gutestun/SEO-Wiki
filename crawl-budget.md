# Crawl Budget

## Definition
[[Google Bot]] is lazy and cheap, so we feed it on a strict diet.

>Not to be confused with [[crawl rate]], crawl budget is an established term for the number of pages that a bot is able to crawl across a period of time — which usually stands as a single day.

>Google shares the same crawl budget between GoogleBot, the organic free web crawler, and Google AdsBot, the paid Google crawler. Keep in mind, Google has dozens of crawlers and they all likely share the same crawl budget.
>This is one of the rare instances where Google's Search team shares anything with the Google Ads team, I guess?

>“There is also not a hard limit on our crawl. The best way to think about it is that the number of pages that we crawl is roughly proportional to your PageRank. So if you have a lot of incoming links on your root page, we’ll definitely crawl that. Then your root page may link to other pages, and those will get PageRank and we’ll crawl those as well. As you get deeper and deeper in your site, however, PageRank tends to decline.”
