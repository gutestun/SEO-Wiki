Proof that nerds can have tall hair and cool moustaches. And write on whiteboards. He made whiteboards bearable! Loves his mum (ran a business with her, you migh have heard of it, [[moz|MOmZ]], or something like that)
When I first started out in SEO all the girls adored him. Those who met him swooned, but respected his wife who was at his side. That's Rand â€“ his decency rubs off on you. That's how great he is. All hail Rand!
