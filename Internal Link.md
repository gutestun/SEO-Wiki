# Internal linking

## Definition
Links from one page on a site to another one on the same site. As opposed to [[Backlink]]. Parth of [[content]] mainly, but becomes [[../Tech SEO]] when dealing with [[../site migration]], [[../link rot]] etc. and we have to work with [[redirect]].

A great way to increase [[ranking]] is to optimise [[Internal Link]]

What [[PageRank]] is calculated from.

## Why focus on internal links?

[[Matt-Cutts]] in [an interview with Stone Temple](https://blogs.perficient.com/2010/03/14/matt-cutts-interviewed-by-eric-enge-2/): (2010! So: Grain of salt)
> “There is also not a hard limit on our crawl. The best way to think about it is that the number of pages that we crawl is roughly proportional to your PageRank. So if you have a lot of incoming links on your root page, we’ll definitely crawl that. Then your root page may link to other pages, and those will get PageRank and we’ll crawl those as well. As you get deeper and deeper in your site, however, PageRank tends to decline.”

## Types of internal links

### What is a natural link?

Google can be a bit vague on the subject, and the subject itself is... It's murky waters...

>Sometimes we content creators create links to help the readers—genuinely. Given the propensity toward short(er) content, readers are unlikely to scroll through an article that's too long, but they might click through to related content as part of their journey on your site.

 >The idea of link building is more vague now than ever. We often suffer from dilemma as there are some misinformation or some bad explanation. Due to it's policy Google will not clearly say anything about their algorithm. As long as I am concerned, "when you have something good to offer you can get something in return".
Here is a blog I have written on 'Technical On Page' https://www.mandmmultimedia...
If anyone have something new to add, I would definitely add his website as a credit or recognition. In the opposite scenario, I would expect the same. What would that be? Natural or unnatural?
