# PageRank

## Definition
A way to assign values to pages based on the network of links between them. Described in an early paper by the founders of Google. [[Not a Ranking Factor]] because it is outdated, but a [[ranking factor]] since Google are still using it.

>DYK that after 18 years we're still using PageRank (and 100s of other signals) in ranking?
