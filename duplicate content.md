# Duplicate Content


## Definition


>While there isn’t a duplicate [[content]] [[penalty]], having similar pages can cause [[cannibalisation]] issues and [[crawling]] and [[indexing]] inefficiencies. Very similar pages should be minimised and high similarity could be a sign of low-quality pages, which haven’t received much love – or just shouldn’t be separate pages in the first place.
