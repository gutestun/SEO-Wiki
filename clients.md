## Definition
The hand you don't bite.

> “When you sell, you should be able to end every line with “and that’s why you’ll get promoted.” Buyers are selfish and so you need to speak their goals and interests. If your primary goal isn’t to make your clients to be more successful, then you’re doing it wrong!”

>“Setting reasonable expectations, meeting those expectations, rinse, repeat. An easy mantra to state, but a more difficult one to perfect.”
