# Canonicals

## Definition
Code in the html that tells the bot "ay, I am not the original, that one over there is!". A [[../signal]], not a [[directive]], means Google can take it or leave it.
	
### Self-canonical
Canonical that points to the same page, i.e. not to a different page. Best practice is that all pages have a canonical, even if it is a self-canonical.
